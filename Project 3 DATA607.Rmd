##  Introduction
Chronic diseases represented seven of the top 10 causes of death in the United States. They are defined broadly as conditions that last 1 year or more and require ongoing medical attention or limit activities of daily living or both. As we group, we would like to better understand the reasons behind the causes for Chronic Diseases. Going forward, this Project is designed to focus on the most valued skills used in Data Science in order to perform an Exploratory Analysis of the US Chrnoic Disease Indicators Dataset. 
  
##  Objective of the Project

The objective of this project is to practice soft skill working in a virtual team. During the project we practised collaborating, knowledge sharing and problem solving in a team remotely.

## Approach

For this project after having detailed discussion, we have decided to use US chronic disease indicators data proposed by Kleber (one of the team members).
Using this dataset, we followed the following approach:

  1. Means of Communication: 
    + We created a Whatsapp group where we can share documents and make a group   calls to discuss how we should do the project. 
    + For the purpose of sharing code and rough drafts we have utilized Github and Rpubs . 
  2. Separate / delegate the work among the team members.
  3. Each individual do their part of the work.
  4. Combine everyone's work to make a final work.

## Motivation

Our motivation behind working as a team is due to the necessity of being able to effectively collaborate in a virtual environment . Working in a virtual team is essential  as it will enhance two of the basic data science soft skills (communiction and collaboration). Nowadays people prefer a more flexible work schedule and working from home due to the inherent desire of maintaing work and life balance. This project has enabled us to practice how to mantain work and life balance working in a virtual team.

## Data information
The Dataset has 124 indicators that are divided in 18 groups. ![Indicator Groups](C:/Users/Javern/Documents/Data Science MS/DATA607/cdi.png)

## Data source
The data was downloaded from the Center For Diseases Control and Prevention [website](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Chronic-Disease-Indicators/U-S-Chronic-Disease-Indicators-CDI-/g4ie-h725) in csv format.


## How to load Dataset

We loaded the [data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators-cdi) into an R dataframe using MySQL RDBMS
```{r}
# 2. variables Settings
db_user <- 'newuser'
db_password <- 'pass'
db_name <- 'uscdi'
db_host <- '127.0.0.1' # localhost for local access
db_port <- 3306
# 3. Read data from db
mydb <-  dbConnect(MySQL(), user = db_user, password = db_password,
                 dbname = db_name, host = db_host, port = db_port)
s <- paste0("SELECT DISTINCT YearStart, YearEnd, Topic, LocationAbbr FROM USChronicDiseaseIndicators WHERE LocationAbbr <> 'US';")
rs <- dbSendQuery(mydb, s)
df <-  fetch(rs, n = -1)
on.exit(dbDisconnect(mydb))
```

This is a snapshot of the loaded dataset showing the indicator groups and the states connected with them.
```{r}
#uf <- df %>% gather(Year, n, YearStart:YearEnd)
kable(df) %>%
  kable_styling("striped", "hovered") %>%
  scroll_box(height = "500px")
```

<br/>We also loaded the data using read.csv for the purpose of indicating missing values of empty strings with an identifier
```{r}
disease <- read.csv("US_CDI.csv", na.strings = "")
```

## Overview of the data
```{r}
glimpse(disease)
```
There are 519,718 observations and 34 variables. 

```{r}
kable(head(disease, 10)) %>% kable_styling(font_size = 10) %>% scroll_box(height = "500px")
```

```{r}
kable(tail(disease, 10)) %>% kable_styling(font_size = 10) %>% scroll_box(height = "500px")
```

### Table of summary Statistics
```{r}
summary(disease)
```

### Visualization of missing value pattern. 
From the data set we can visualize the missing value pattern. Read areas of the following graph indicated missing values. 
```{r}
missmap(disease)
```

<br/>From the summary statistics and missing value plot we can see that the data set has 37% missing values and most of them are in the following variables
```{r}
names(-which(colMeans(is.na(disease))>0.1))
```

#### Count number of missing values in each column
```{r}
lapply(disease, function(x){sum(is.na(x))})
```


## Tidying and Transformation

Drop columns that have more than 10% missing
```{r}
disease_no_miss <- disease[, -which(colMeans(is.na(disease)) > 0.1)]
```

After dropping the columns with more than 10% missing values we saw how much the dataset was reduced. There are only 18 variables left.
```{r}
dim(disease_no_miss)

kable(head(disease_no_miss, 200)) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 10) %>%
  scroll_box(height = "500px")
```

Also here is another glimpse of the reduced dataset.

```{r}
glimpse(disease_no_miss)
```



## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Top 5 location with chronic disease
```{r}
disease_no_miss %>%
    count(LocationDesc)%>%
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%
    head(5) %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()
```
### Bottom 5 location with chronic disease
```{r}
disease_no_miss %>%
    count(LocationDesc)%>%
    arrange(-desc(n)) %>%
    head(5) %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()
```


### Top 5 Data Source with chronic disease
```{r}
disease_no_miss %>%
    count(DataSource)%>%
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%
    head(5) %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()
```

### Bottom 5 Data Source with chronic disease
```{r}
disease_no_miss %>%
    count(DataSource)%>%
    arrange(-desc(n)) %>%
    head(5) %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()
```

### Bar plot of Chronic Diseases
```{r}
topic <- as.data.frame(table(disease_no_miss$Topic))
ggplot(topic, aes(x=Var1, y =Freq, color = Var1))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + ggtitle("Distribution of Chronic Disease Topics") + theme(legend.position = "none") + coord_flip() + xlab("Chronic Diseases")
#barplot(table(disease_no_miss$Topic), main = "Distribution of Chronic Disease Topics")
```

<br/>From the bar plot we can see that most of the chronic diseases are the following top 5
```{r}
disease_no_miss %>%
    count(Topic)%>%
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%
    head(5) %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()
```

### Visualization of data value type
```{r}
data_value_type <- as.data.frame(table(disease_no_miss$DataValueType))

ggplot(data_value_type, aes(x=Var1, y =Freq))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + ggtitle("Distribution of Data Value Types") + theme(legend.position = "none") + coord_flip() + xlab("Data Value Types")
```

### Top data value types are the following
```{r}
disease_no_miss %>%
    count(DataValueType)%>%
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%
    head(5) %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()
```

### Stratification Category
```{r}
stratificationCat <- as.data.frame(table(disease_no_miss$StratificationCategory1))

ggplot(stratificationCat, aes(x=Var1, y =Freq, fill = Var1))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + ggtitle("Classification of Observants") + theme(legend.position = "none")+ xlab("Categories")

```


* * *

We decided to take a closer look at one of the top 5 causes of chronic diseases.


### Tobacco
As mentioned earlier, Tobacco is one of the top Chronic Disease Indicator of preventable deaths in the US. Smoking leads to disease and disability and harms nearly every organ of the body. Among the other indicator groups, using Tobacco is related to *cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung diseases, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis*. You can view further details [<span style="color:blue">here</span> ](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/index.htm)

```{r}

mydb <-  dbConnect(MySQL(), user = db_user, password = db_password,
                 dbname = db_name, host = db_host, port = db_port)
s <- paste0("SELECT * FROM USChronicDiseaseIndicators WHERE Topic = 'Tobacco' AND LocationAbbr <> 'US';")
rs <- dbSendQuery(mydb, s)
tblTobacco <-  fetch(rs, n = -1)
on.exit(dbDisconnect(mydb))

Tobacco_df <- tblTobacco
dim(Tobacco_df)
kable(head(Tobacco_df, 20)) %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T,  font_size = 10) %>%  scroll_box(height = "500px")
```


```{r}
Tobacco_df <- Tobacco_df[!sapply(Tobacco_df, function(t) all(t == ""))]
Tobacco_df <- Tobacco_df %>% select("YearEnd", "LocationAbbr", "Question", "DataValue", "Stratification1", ResponseID) %>% separate(ResponseID, c("Latitude", "Longitude"), sep = ",")

#remove none digit elements from the observations in both longitude and latitude columns and then convert remaining characters to numeric
Tobacco_df$Latitude <- as.numeric(unlist(str_remove(Tobacco_df$Latitude, "^[(]"))) 
Tobacco_df$Longitude <- as.numeric(unlist(str_remove(Tobacco_df$Longitude, "[)]$")))
#rename a few columns
names(Tobacco_df)[c(1, 2, 5)] <- c("Year", "State", "Stratification")
#If any cell for the row is empty then remove the row
Tobacco_df <- Tobacco_df[!Tobacco_df$DataValue == "", ]
```


After making changes to the Tobacco dataframe, here is a preview to a more condensed form
```{r}
dim(Tobacco_df)
kable(head(Tobacco_df, 100)) %>% kable_styling(font_size = 10) %>%  scroll_box(height = "500px")
```

#### Questions observed
These are the type of questions looked at concerning Tobacco
```{r}
Questions <- unique(Tobacco_df$Question)
kable(Questions) %>% kable_styling(font_size = 12) %>%  scroll_box(height = "300px")
```

<br/>A second Tobacco Dataframe was created because some of the DataValues are categorical (Yes, No) while others are numeric.The first Tobacco Dataframe now has 18681 obs with 7 variables.
```{r}
#separate categorical datavalues from numerical ones and place in a new df
Tobacco_df2 <- subset(Tobacco_df, Tobacco_df$DataValue == c("Yes","No"))
dim(Tobacco_df2)
kable(Tobacco_df2) %>% kable_styling(font_size = 10) %>%  scroll_box(height = "300px")
#remove those placed in Tobacco_df2 from Tobacco_df
new_Tobacco_df <- Tobacco_df[!(Tobacco_df$DataValue %in% Tobacco_df2$DataValue), ]
#convert the datavalue column to numeric
new_Tobacco_df$DataValue <- as.numeric(new_Tobacco_df$DataValue)
new_Tobacco_df$Year <- as.numeric(new_Tobacco_df$Year)
dim(new_Tobacco_df)
```

<br />
<div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid">

#### Exploration of Tobacco

```{r}
ggplotly(ggplot(new_Tobacco_df, aes(x=State, y=Year, fill=Year)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + theme(axis.text=element_text(size=6)) + ggtitle("Data collected Over the years for States Concerning Tobacco"))
```
<br/> Kansas had a lot to say as most reports came from that state


```{r}
new_Tobacco_df %>% filter(Question == c("Current smokeless tobacco use among youth", "Current cigarette smoking among youth")) %>%  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = DataValue, fill = Question)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge())+ ggtitle("Youth (Grade 9-12) Using Tobacco Over the Years") +  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c("Smokeless Tobacco", "Smoke Tobacco"))
```
<br/>It is likely that if the yout is using smokeless Tobacco, then they'll smoke it too.



```{r}
new_Tobacco_df %>% filter(!Stratification == "Overall") %>%  ggplot(aes(x= Stratification, y=Year, fill=Stratification)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + theme(axis.text=element_text(size=6)) + transition_time(round(Year)) + labs(title = "Year: {frame_time}")
```
Based on this research, most of Tobacco customers are Male and the top race is White.

#### Amount of Tobacco Product Excise Tax?

##### Increasing the price of tobacco discourages people from buying them, especially youths. With this structure put into place, improvements in health will get better in the long term. Majority of the states did not excise tax from the Tobacco product.
```{r}
Tobacco_df2 %>%  filter(Question == "Amount of tobacco product excise tax") %>% ggplot(aes(x = DataValue)) + geom_bar() 
```

</div>

<br />

<div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid">

#### States that allow stronger local tobacco control and prevention laws
##### Map below shows which States did and did not allow stronger laws.
```{r}
Tobacco_df2 %>%  filter(Question == "States that allow stronger local tobacco control and prevention laws") %>% ggplot(aes(x = DataValue)) + geom_bar() 
ggmap::register_google(key = "AIzaSyAPKYO8wG3mQUqSL6Ym4HeSIjkZmCwwVP8")
leaflet(options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 2, maxZoom = 8)) %>% 
  addProviderTiles("Esri") %>% 
  setView(lng = -100.166666, lat = 48.166666, zoom = 4) %>% 
  addMarkers(lng =Tobacco_df2$Longitude, lat = Tobacco_df2$Latitude, popup = Tobacco_df2$State, label = Tobacco_df2$DataValue)

## Conclusion

> Real world data sets are often messy and have lot's of missing values. From the exploratory analysis we've found that Diabetes, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Cardiovascular Disease, Arthritis are the most occurring chronic diseases. 
From the overall analysis we've learned that the chronic diseases are a major concern in the USA though the data set is missing several necessary information.
Arizona,Florida,Iowa have most chronic disease while Guam,Virgin Islands have least disease.
